{\small In 1966 Cyril Burt published a paper called ``The genetic determination of differences in intelligence: A study of monozygotic twins reared apart?" The data consist of IQ scores for [an assumed random sample of] 27 identical twins, one raised by foster parents, the other by the biological parents.}

\frametitle{Recap}

\begin{itemize}

\item Inference for the slope for a single-predictor linear regression model:
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item Hypothesis test:
\[ T = \frac{b_1 - null~value}{SE_{b_1}} \qquad df = n - 2 \]
\pause
\item Confidence interval:
\[ b_1 \pm t^\star_{df = n - 2} SE_{b_1} \]
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item The null value is often 0 since we are usually checking for \hl{any} relationship between the explanatory and the response variable.

\pause

\item The regression output gives $b_1$, $SE_{b_1}$, and \hl{two-tailed} p-value for the $t$-test for the slope where the null value is 0.

\pause

\item We rarely do inference on the intercept, so we'll be focusing on the estimates and inference for the slope.

\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Caution}

\begin{itemize}

\item Always be aware of the type of data you're working with: random sample, non-random sample, or population.

\pause

\item Statistical inference, and the resulting p-values, are meaningless when you already have population data.

\pause

\item If you have a sample that is non-random (biased), inference on the results will be unreliable.

\pause

\item The ultimate goal is to have independent observations.

\end{itemize}
