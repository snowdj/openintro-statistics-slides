A two-way table separating the students by grade and by choice of most important factor is shown below. Do these data provide evidence to suggest that goals vary by grade?}

\begin{itemize}
\item The hypotheses are:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$H_0$:] Grade and goals are independent. Goals do not vary by grade.
\item[$H_A$:] Grade and goals are dependent. Goals vary by grade.
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item The test statistic is calculated as
\[ \chi^2_{df} = \sum_{i = 1}^{k} \frac{(O - E)^2}{E} \quad \text{ where } \quad df = (R - 1) \times (C - 1), \]
where $k$ is the number of cells, $R$ is the number of rows, and $C$ is the number of columns.

\Note{We calculate $df$ differently for one-way and two-way tables.}

\pause

\item The p-value is the area under the $\chi^2_{df}$ curve, above the calculated test statistic.
