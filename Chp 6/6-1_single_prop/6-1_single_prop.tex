Sample proportions will be nearly normally distributed with mean equal to the population mean, $p$, and standard error equal to $\sqrt{\frac{p~(1-p)}{n}}$.
\[ \hat{p} \sim N \pr{ mean = p, SE = \sqrt{\frac{p~(1-p)}{n}} } \]

But of course this is true only under certain conditions...

\dq{Any guesses?}

Given: $n = 670, \hat{p} = 0.85$. First check conditions.

\pause
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item \hl{Independence}: The sample is random, and 670 $<$ 10\% of all Americans, therefore we can assume that one respondent's response is independent of another.
\pause
\item \hl{Success-failure}: 571 people answered correctly (successes) and 99 answered incorrectly (failures), both are greater than 10.
\end{enumerate}

... use $\hat{p} = 0.5$

\dq{why?}
\pause

\begin{itemize}
\item if you don't know any better, 50-50 is a good guess

\begin{itemize}
