\begin{itemize}

\item Below is a histogram of the distribution of heights of US adults. 

\item The proportion of data that falls in the shaded bins gives the probability that a randomly sampled US adult is between 180 cm and 185 cm (about 5'11" to 6'1").

\end{itemize}

\subsection{From histograms to continuous distributions}

Since height is a continuous numerical variable, its \hl{probability density function} is a smooth curve.

\subsection{Probabilities from continuous distributions}

Therefore, the probability that a randomly sampled US adult is between 180 cm and 185 cm can also be estimated as the shaded area under the curve.

Since continuous probabilities are estimated as ``the area under the curve", the probability of a person being exactly 180 cm (or any exact value) is defined as 0.
