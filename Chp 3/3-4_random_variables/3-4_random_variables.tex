\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Random variables}

\begin{itemize}

\item A \hl{random variable} is a numeric quantity whose value depends on the outcome of a random event
\begin{itemize}
\item We use a capital letter, like $X$, to denote a random variable
\item The values of a random variable are denoted with a lowercase letter, in this case $x$
\item For example, $P(X = x)$
\end{itemize}

\item There are two types of random variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item \hl{Discrete random variables} often take only integer values
\begin{itemize}
\item Example: Number of credit hours, Difference in number of credit hours this term vs last
\end{itemize}
\item \hl{Continuous random variables} take real (decimal) values
\begin{itemize}
\item Example: Cost of books this term, Difference in cost of books this term vs last
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Expectation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Expectation}

\begin{itemize}

\item We are often interested in the average outcome of a random variable.

\item We call this the \hl{expected value} (mean), and it is a weighted average of the possible outcomes
\formula{\[\mu = E(X) = \sum_{i = 1}^k x_i ~ P(X = x_i)\]}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Variability}

We are also often interested in the variability in the values of a random variable.

\formula{
\[ \sigma^2 = Var(X) = \sum_{i = 1}^k (x_i - E(X))^2 P(X = x_i) \]
\[ \sigma = SD(X) = \sqrt{Var(X)} \]
}
