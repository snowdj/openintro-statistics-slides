\frametitle{Diamonds}

\begin{itemize}

\item Weights of diamonds are measured in carats. 

\item 1 carat = 100 points, 0.99 carats = 99 points, etc.

\item The difference between the size of a 0.99 carat diamond and a 1 carat diamond is undetectable to the naked human eye, but does the price of a 1 carat diamond tend to be higher than the price of a 0.99 diamond?

\item We are going to test to see if there is a difference between the average prices of 0.99 and 1 carat diamonds.

\item In order to be able to compare equivalent units, we divide the prices of 0.99 carat diamonds by 99 and 1 carat diamonds by 100, and compare the average point prices.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Point price of one 0.99 carat diamond in the sample should be independent of another, and the point price of one 1 carat diamond should independent of another as well.

{The test statistic for inference on the difference of two means where $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are unknown is the $T$ statistic.

where 
\[ SE = \sqrt{ \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} } \qquad \text{ and } \qquad df = min(n_1 - 1, n_2 - 1) \]

\Note{The calculation of the $df$ is actually much more complicated. For simplicity we'll use the above formula to \underline{estimate} the true $df$ when conducting the analysis by hand.}

\subsection{Recap}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Recap: Inference using difference of two small sample means}

\begin{itemize}

\item If $\sigma_1$ or $\sigma_2$ is unknown, difference between the sample means follow a $t$-distribution with $SE = \sqrt{ \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_1} }$.

\pause

\item Conditions: 
\begin{itemize}
\item independence within groups (often verified by a random sample, and if sampling without replacement, $n < $ 10\% of population) and between groups
\item no extreme skew in either group
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item Hypothesis testing: 
\[ T_{df} = \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{SE}\text{, where }df = min(n_1 - 1, n_2 - 1) \]

\pause

\item Confidence interval:
\[ \text{point estimate} \pm t_{df}^\star \times SE \]

\end{itemize}
