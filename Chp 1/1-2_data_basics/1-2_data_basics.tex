\subsection{Observations and variables}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Classroom survey}

A survey was conducted on students in an introductory statistics course. Below are a few of the questions on the survey, and the corresponding variables the data from the responses were stored in:

\begin{itemize}
\item \var{gender}: What is your gender? 
\item \var{intro\_extra}: What is your gender? 
\item \var{sleep}: How many hours do you sleep at night, on average?
\item \var{bedtime}: What time do you usually go to bed?
\item \var{countries}: How many countries have you visited?
\item \var{dread}: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you dread being here?
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

Data collected on students in a statistics class on a variety of variables:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l cccc l}
		& \hl{variable} \\
		& \hl{$\downarrow$}	 \\
\cline{1-5}
Stu.	&	\var{gender}	&	\var{intro\_extra} & $\cdots$ & \var{dread} \\
\cline{1-5}
1 & male & extravert  & $\cdots$ & 3 \\ 
  2 & female & extravert & $\cdots$ & 2 \\ 
  3 & female & introvert  & $\cdots$ & 4 & \hl{$\leftarrow$}  \\ 
  4 & female & extravert  & $\cdots$ & 2 & \hl{observation} \\
$\vdots$	&	$\vdots$	  &	$\vdots$  &	$\vdots$ &	$\vdots$ \\
86	& male & extravert & $\cdots$& 3 \\
\cline{1-5}

}
{
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{1-2_data_basics/figures/possum_head_skull/possum_head_skull}
}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item There is no relationship between head length and skull width, i.e. the variables are independent.
\solnMult{Head length and skull width are positively associated.}
\item Skull width and head length are negatively associated.
\item A longer head causes the skull to be wider.
\item A wider skull causes the head to be longer.
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Associated vs. independent}

\begin{itemize}

\item When two variables show some connection with one another, they are called \hl{associated} variables.
\begin{itemize}
\item Associated variables can also be called \hl{dependent} variables and vice-versa.
\end{itemize}

\item If two variables are not associated, i.e. there is no evident connection between the two, then they are said to be \hl{independent}.

\end{itemize}
